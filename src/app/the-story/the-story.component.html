            <p>Back in the day, when old, comely buildings huddled in the center and vast stretches of greenery adorned
                the city parks,
                the idea of The Hidden Island wasnâ€™t just a telltale - children truly believed. But that was then.</p>
            <p>As the city evolved, the industrial sites outgrew the roofs of their homes, factories blighted the air,
                and the
                skyscraping high-rise towers devoured the skyline. The air, now putrid and foul, polluted the memories
                of the fairytale.
                Yet still, some kids kept their beliefs intact.</p>
